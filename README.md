# fp-intro-slides
Yet Another Introduction to functional programming (in Java)

## Summary

This course is a work in progress which aims to introduce basic functional programming concepts and constructs
to people already familiar with the Java programming language.

This repository contains the "slides" for the course. In addition [a repo with example code](https://github.com/dimitarg/fpintro-exercises)
and exercises is available.

The notes here are currently not intended / ready for self learning. They are rather intended as speaker notes for an 
instructor presenting the material.
